MCU
Read up on the STM32G474
Need external syncronized clock
Use QSPI peripheral to output data to FPGA, configure it in register mode with dual bank mode.
--Example of DAC in IDE called signal generation.

Looked into ST32G474. First attempted configuration of ADC, DAC, DMA, and PWM. Still have to look through the DMA example and better understand the MCU. 
Test by Friday 5k values going out to the DAC being triggered by a PWM.

Configured DAC, DMA, and Timer but still need to test with o-scope.

Looked at STM tutorial videos:

Created buffer with test values and ran it but o-scope tests show nothing.
