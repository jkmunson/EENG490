\subsection{Motivation}
The university already has a device that purports to fulfill this purpose, the Elvis III. However, the Elvis III has severe shortcomings that make it unable to perform the work that it is expected to. In addition to this, they cost well over \$3000. We believe that we can make a capable piece of test equipment for much less than a single Elvis III. Additionally, team members are seeking opportunities to work with FPGA devices and this project fits that well.
