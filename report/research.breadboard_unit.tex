\subsection{Bread Board Unit}
	While test equipment often has BNC connectors, or test leads, or banana plug jacks to connect wires to your project, we would like to take a different approach. We want to have a breadboard that can be switched onto all of the possible connections at each pin in software. This lets up place components down on a breadboard, use jumper wires to form the connections, then apply a stimulus with the signal generator or power rail functionality using software. This allows exploring a wide variety of stimuli quickly. Since every pin will also be an analog logic analyzer channel we will be able to visualize the operation of the entire circuit at once.
