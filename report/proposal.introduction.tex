\subsection{Introduction}
In engineering laboratories and industrial settings, electrical engineers make use of a wide variety of test equipment. The large number of devices becomes difficult to manage on a desktop, especially in a University setting where twenty or more stations need to fit into a single room. We will construct a product that is able to cover all of the common test-equipment and lab needs for electrical engineering education with a single device that is still capable enough to fit into industrial use.
