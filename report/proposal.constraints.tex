	\begin{itemize}
		\item Time
			\begin{itemize}
			\item College classes will take time away from the final project.
			\item Downtime waiting on part delivery.
			\end{itemize}
		\item The project isn't intended to have a high cost but the intended customizability means there is a limit to how cheap the project will be.
		\item Part availability shouldn't be too much of a problem however certain aspects of the design require parts with the right specifications.
