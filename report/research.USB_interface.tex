\subsection{USB 3.2 Gen 1 Interface}
	The all-important interface that allows data to be delivered to a computer to be analyzed: the USB 3 interface. Our project is extremely data intensive so we had to find a solution that would have high bandwidth at a low cost. We decided to use Infineon's EZ-USB™ FX3. It is relatively affordable and it can transfer data at five gigabits per second. It can be configured for most common peripheral communication protocols such as I²C, I²S, UART, and SPI but we will be configuring it to run, effectively, our own communication protocol because that allows us to use the full 32-bit wide parallel bus. This will allow us to get the high data rates that we need to get all the data from the FPGA to the computer application.
