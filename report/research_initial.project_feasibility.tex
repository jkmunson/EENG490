\subsection{Project Feasibility}
	Wanting a product to exist is all well and good, but if we don't consider the many moving parts needed to build a working product then we could be left with nothing but a dream, and no substance.
	
	\subsubsection{Oscilloscope}
	The oscilloscope really is the center-piece of the design. Preliminary research shows than often, oscilloscope manufacturers resort to ASIC\footnote{Application Specific Integrated Circuit} silicon for the Analog-to-digital conversion components. Since we don't have the millions of dollars and years of engineer time to design an ASIC, we will need to find a readily available chip that can perform the ADC conversions at an acceptable rate for an oscilloscope.
