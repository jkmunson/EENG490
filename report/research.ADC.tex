\subsection{Gsps ADC: HMCAD2011}
	The core of the oscilloscope design, the Analog To Digital converter takes the analog voltages that we want to measure. This part will be capable of high speed data collection, with standard sampling rates. This will provide a relatively cheap yet effective means for data collection.
