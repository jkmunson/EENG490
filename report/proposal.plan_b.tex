\section{Plan B}
Every project needs a contingency plan and this is no exception. We are excited about our plan A but it is also quite difficult. Our plan B is to use our EZ-USBâ„¢ FX3 and a custom printed circuit board as a logic analyzer. We will use NGScopeClient to display the information we gather as we do in plan A. This is a good backup plan because we are going to do it anyway when we first set up the chip and NGScopeClient. Ideally, this part should be done in the first month of the Spring quarter but if we face many surprises and the project takes longer than expected this will still give us a very useful product.
