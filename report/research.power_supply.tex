\subsection{Power Supply}
	There are multiple aspects to the power supply. The standard power from the wall is 120v which must be stepped down to the desired voltages. There will be multiple voltage step downs, the first being accomplished by a switching power supply that will bring the voltage down to 24v. From there several voltage step down circuits will be placed in parallel, each will step the voltage down to a different amount. The range of voltages currently intended is 15v, 10v, 5v, and 3,3v. These voltages will have to be buffered to avoid causing any noise to the board as the board will feature an oscilloscope that will be sensitive to the noise.
