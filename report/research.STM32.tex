\subsection{STM32, Providing ADC and DAC for logic analyzer}
The STM32G474RE is a critical part of the design. It has several ADC's and DAC's at its disposal with a variety of useful configurations. Four 12-bit unbuffered internal DAC channels with 15 MSPS allows the board incredibly fast output, providing accurate data display for high speed processes. Five 12-bit ADC's provide the board with means to sample and gather data.
