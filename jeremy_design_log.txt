Started EZ USB dev board design
Decided on 50x50mm 6-layer PCB + stencils, whichi will cost ~$19 + ship from jlcpcb
There is no footprint or symbol for the EZ USB in kicad -> Imported from samacsys and verified footprint & symbol briefly

For the crystal Oscilator, a 19.2Mhz crystal & appropriate load caps are required. Added to mouser cart.

For the watchdog timer, a 32khz crystal is required. These crystals are expensive (>$1), So I'm omitting them.

The clock source selection requires a pull up or pull down on FSLC pins. Placing a solder bridge jumper to gnd, and a resistor network for pull up.
Pulling up to "CVDDQ" because that is the IO's power domain.

Now considering the connector between the pcb and the computer. For USB 2.0, this would be the Micro USB or Mini USB, or other connectors.

USB C is somewhat complex to implement (requiring an additional MUX chip) but can provide more power.
Do we need more power? -> The EZ USB draws 200mA for the core, 60mA for the USB, and up to 16mA per IO, (but this much likely isn't necessary).
We are planning to do 32 data + clk + some control lines of I/O, so if we call that 36 lines @ 16mA then the total (max) power draw is 640mA for the I/O.
This gives a total (absolute max) power draw for the chip at 836mA*

It is worth noting, that the chip operates at a core voltage of 1.2v, and I/O voltages of 3.3v(by our selection).

836mA is below the USB 3.0 type A spec of 900mA, so we could safely use linear voltage regulators for these power supplies, and still have sufficient power delivery from a usb 3.0 type A port.

Assuming 80% efficiency of the buck regulators I intend to use, we will need (1.2v/5v)/.8 * 260mA + (3.3v/5v)/.8 * 640mA = 78ma + 528ma = 606mA (maximum) of power from the usb port. This leaves a decent margin on the power a USB 3 port can provide.

So, all of that said, I believe that the best choice for a usb plug for our device is going to be a USB 3 A/B plug, and then we purchase USB 3 type A and C to USB 3 AB cables to allow the device to be used on either a desktop with 3.0 type A ports, or a laptop with type c ports.

By using the type AB plug, we avoid the added complexity and cost of type C and the connection switching MUX.

I ordered the appropriate receptacles from aliexpress. (The receptacles were $3/ea on mouser, compared to 40 for $5 shipped on aliexpress.)
